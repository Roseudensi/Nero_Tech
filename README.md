Hi Nero, i know you get to read this, you are an amazing soul.
I know you are not happy about the job hunting thing, but be assured the world needs your talent and they cant bycott it, keep your head up. 
don't give up job hunting can be tough, but you are tougher. every no brings you closer to the "yes" you deserve. keep pushing forward, stay positive, and believe in yourself. 
your dream job is out there, and it's waiting for you. you've got this! 
You're capable, talented, and deserving, don't loose hope, job hunting is temporary, but your potential is limitless.
